# Mini-Search-Engine-Web-browser

This project is a mini search engine and web browser built in C++ with a focus on high performance, efficient data handling, and a smooth user experience. Designed to retrieve documents based on keyword queries, it fully supports Boolean operators like AND and OR, which provides users with flexible search capabilities. The search engine component is optimized with data structures such as AVL trees and hash tables, ensuring rapid indexing and retrieval even when handling complex search queries. By implementing a query caching mechanism, the engine reduces redundant operations, enhancing performance and efficiency.

The web browser component processes URLs and constructs hyperlink graphs to analyze web connectivity, mapping out relationships between web pages. This feature allows users to visualize the interconnections between sites and provides insights into website structures and link flows. Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly graphical interface that enables users to view search results and site connectivity clearly. The interface design emphasizes accessibility and usability, making it easy to navigate through both search results and site structures.

On the backend, the project utilizes SQLite for efficient data management, supporting fast and reliable indexing and storage of historical data and document collections. The application also includes diverse datasets across domains such as technology, health, and education, which helps to test its adaptability and scalability. This mini search engine and web browser showcase C++'s power in creating real-world applications that merge data structures, algorithms, and user interaction, providing an invaluable tool for exploring the fields of information retrieval and web connectivity analysis.
